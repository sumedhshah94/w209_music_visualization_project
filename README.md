# w209_final_project


The final project for MIDS w209. We created this project for both record producers and everyday music lovers to visualize music over time. We wanted to visualize how audio features and music genres have changed throughout the years and also understand how it might differ from popular songs. We encourage you to use our dashboards and visualizations to explore music and identify songs that are similar to your favorites.

We utilized a dataset of Spotify songs from 1980 to 2020, which includes information about the song, artist, and audio features like danceability, valence, and acousticness. We also leveraged the Billboard Top 100 Chart data to identify which songs were popular hits.
